Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s. 									
You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:
Input:

"bbbab"
Output:
4
One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb". 
//bbbb is valid because it is a SUBSEQUENCE OF string, not a substring


Example 2:
Input:

"cbbd"
Output:
2
