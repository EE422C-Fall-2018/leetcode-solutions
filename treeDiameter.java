Given an undirected tree, return its diameter: the number of edges in a longest path in that tree.

The tree is given as an array of edges where edges[i] = [u, v] is a bidirectional edge between nodes u and v.  
Each node has labels in the set {0, 1, ..., edges.length}.

Example 1:

Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]
Output: 2
