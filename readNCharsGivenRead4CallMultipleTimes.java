Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method read4, implement a method 
read to read n characters. Your method read may be called multiple times.

 

Method read4:

The API read4 reads 4 consecutive characters from the file, then writes those characters into the buffer array buf.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that read4() has its own file pointer, much like FILE *fp in C.

Definition of read4:

    Parameter:  char[] buf
    Returns:    int

Note: buf[] is destination not source, the results from read4 will be copied to buf[]



/**
 * The read4 API is defined in the parent class Reader4.
 *     int read4(char[] buf); 
 */

public class Solution extends Reader4 {
    /**
     * @param buf Destination buffer
     * @param n   Maximum number of characters to read
     * @return    The number of characters read
     */
    char[] prevBuf = new char[4];
    int prevSize = 0; //size of previous buff call
    int prevIndex = 0; //index of previous buff call 
    
    public int read(char[] buf, int n) {
        int counter = 0;
        
        while (counter < n) {
            if (prevIndex < prevSize) {
                buf[counter++] = prevBuf[prevIndex++];
            } else {
                prevSize = read4(prevBuf);
                prevIndex = 0;
                if (prevSize == 0) {
                    // no more data to consume from stream
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return counter;
    }
