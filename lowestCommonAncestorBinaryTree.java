// Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

// According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: â€œThe lowest common ancestor is defined 
// between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)



//Use partents hashmap to keep track of parent nodes
//THEN, use a hashset to find all ancestors of p,
//THEN, keep iterating on q until we find first common ancestor 

//TC: O(N) where n is number of nodes in tree, to go through all of the nodes in tree
//SC: O(N) to store all of the parents
